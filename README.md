Customer Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment is the emotion behind customer engagement.

When you monitor sentiment, you try to measure the tone, context, and feeling from customer actions.

Whether a customer completes a purchase, leaves a review, or mentions your company socially, there is always an emotional state connected to their action.

Customer sentiment can range anywhere from pleased or loving to neutral or angry, and no matter where your customers fall on the sentiment spectrum, it’s imperative you understand not only what their emotional state is, but what’s driving it.



2. Problem Statement
Analyzing customer sentiment helps give insight into how customers feel about your brand.

The more you listen to how your customers feel about recommending your company, giving you a rating, engaging with you on social channels, and giving you direct feedback, the more love everyone is sure to feel, and the deeper your relationships can be.
